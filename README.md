# Version Notation
IFC versions are identified using the sematic versioning notation "Major.Minor.Addendum.Corrigendum".

- Major versions consist of scope expansions or deletions and may have changes that break compatibility.
- Minor versions consist of feature extensions, where compatibility is guaranteed for the "core" schema, but not for other definitions.
- Addendums consist of improvements to existing features, where the schema may change but upward compatibility is guaranteed.
- Corrigendums consist of improvements to documentation, where the schema does not change though deprecation is possible.

# Which version do I use?
The latest version, IFC 4.1 is recommended for all current developments, which is fully backward compatible with IFC 4.0. Core definitions within IFC 4.1 and 4.0 are backward compatible with IFC 2.3.
